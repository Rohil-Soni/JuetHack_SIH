Unity AR Model Loader with AWS S3 & Redis
[![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2022.3.62f1-black?ps://img.shields.io![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Android-green?logo=t dynamically loads 3D models from AWS S3 using Redis caching and Vuforia ground plane detection. Built for SIH 2025 hackathon project.

üöÄ Features
Core Functionality
AR Ground Plane Detection - Vuforia-powered surface tracking

Dynamic Model Loading - Runtime GLB/GLTF loading from AWS S3

Redis Integration - Fast metadata caching and retrieval

Smart Fallback System - Colorful cubes when API fails

Build-Safe Development - Toggle API calls for editor vs builds

Advanced Features
AR Stability System - Drift correction and anchor stabilization

Interactive Placement - Tap-to-place models with ground detection

Local Anchor Caching - Persistent AR positions between sessions

Physics Integration - Automatic rigidbody and collider generation

Performance Monitoring - Real-time FPS and network status

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Script Configuration
Attach VuforiaAWSRedisLoader.cs to a GameObject and configure:

csharp
[Header("=== BUILD MODE CONTROL ===")]
public bool enableAPICallsInEditor = false; // UNCHECK for building

[Header("=== AWS REDIS CONFIGURATION ===")]  
public string apiBaseUrl = "http://43.205.215.100:5000";
public string[] availableModelKeys = {"model:temple1", "model:temple2", "model:building1"};

[Header("=== MODEL CONFIGURATION ===")]
public float modelScale = 0.1f;
public GameObject[] fallbackPrefabs; // Optional custom fallbacks
API Response Format
Your Redis API should return:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "key": "model:temple1", 
  "value": {
    "s3_path": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/temple1.glb",
    "scale": "0.1",
    "rotation": "0,0,0"
  }
}
üéÆ Usage
Getting Started
Build and install APK on ARCore-compatible Android device

Grant camera permissions when prompted

Point camera at ground until plane is detected

Tap screen to place 3D models at detected positions

Debug Features (Editor Only)
Toggle API Calls - Test with/without network

Load Specific Models - Test individual model keys

Monitor Performance - View FPS and network status

Cache Management - Save/clear anchor positions

üèó Architecture
Key Components
VuforiaAWSRedisLoader.cs - Main AR controller script

Ground Plane Detection - Vuforia plane finding and tracking

Model Loading Pipeline - Coroutine-based GLB loading

Stability System - Drift correction and smooth positioning

Local Caching - Anchor persistence and session management

Build Safety
Development Mode - API calls disabled during builds

Production Mode - Full functionality in final APK

Automatic Fallbacks - Colored cubes when models fail to load

Network Detection - Offline/online handling

üîß Troubleshooting
Common Build Issues
Error	Solution
"Cannot build player while importing"	Delete Library/ and Temp/ folders
"Vulkan not supported"	Switch to Built-in Render Pipeline
"Package Name error"	Set valid package name: com.company.app
"Input Handling warning"	Set to "Input Manager (Old)"
Runtime Issues
Models not loading: Check internet connection and API server status

Ground plane not detected: Point camera at textured flat surface

App crashes: Ensure minimum API level 29 and ARM64 architecture

Poor performance: Reduce model complexity or disable physics

üì± Deployment
Supported Devices
Android 10.0+ (API Level 29+)

ARCore compatible devices (Check compatibility)

Minimum 3GB RAM recommended

Build Process
Set enableAPICallsInEditor = false
